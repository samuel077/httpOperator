# httpOperator
This is the httpOperator I created for simple httpRequest in Android. I hope that I can design this for RESTFul api. A jsonOperator might be needed as well. 

# web service in RESTFul (CRUD) 
The target in this app is able to send different request to web server with four basic operation of an website object. 
Create : POST
Read   : GET
Update : PUT
Delete : DELETE
